<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Give the reader a broad overview of the landscape in which the proposed change is being built.</em></p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Explain the motivation for the change and why we should aim to address it.</em></p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>A short list of bullet points of what the scope of the change is.
Note: It is often helpful to state explicitly what is not expected to be in the scope.</em></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Given the background, explain the high-level idea of your proposed solution.</em></p>
<h3>System Architecture</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Describe the system on a high level and put it into context. Diagram usually works great â€” e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system context diagram</a>. Explain components and how they relate to each other.</em></p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ *Explain how the components communicate. Diagrams with some context usually work great â€” e.g. <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sdy9Au0Ibv3aseGZyIKNwivgqnaZ0FqF1mUgIzZY7ZIqppJeZVqUl3Iundy0qzwJLSMdFyA-oysP5YGv5pNYpI11m9A5AY0Oqdqj=s0">data/control flow diagrams</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have a clear idea you can further sketch APIs and explain mechanics â€” e.g. Kafka/HTTP, protocol â€” e.g. JSON/Protobuf, REST/gRPC â€” and message schema for how components communicate.*</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Think about data in your design. Start with high-level entities and drill down to how the system works with the actual data when implemented.</em></p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Think about key entities in your design, which system owns them and how do they relate inside or across the systems.</em>
<em>Hint: Don't think about database tables just yet!</em></p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Explain a bit more about any data storage considerations â€” databases or other storage affected, data model, formats, etc.</em></p>
<h2>Further Considerations</h2>
<h3>Previous Art</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Are there any previous attempts to solve this problem? Provide references, links, or further context.</em></p>
<h3>Alternative Approaches Considered</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Were any alternatives considered as a solution to this problem? Provide a short description of the pros and cons of each.</em></p>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>What questions are left open and would you like to discuss them with the audience?</em></p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <em>Are you planning to call a design review meeting and start to code the prototype immediately, or are you hoping to have a broad discussion? Clarify your plan going forward.</em></p>
